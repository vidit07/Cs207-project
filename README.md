# Cs207-project
The project is creation of “Kitchen Timer”. It can be elaborated as a thing in which we can set a timer for a certain period of time and as soon as the timer hits its limit, the speaker attached with the timer automatically switches on.

The Kitchen Timer consist total of Eight Components. All components are named as follows: 

1.	Adafruit Standard LCD – 16x2
2.	Sparkfun Pushbutton switch 
3.	Resistor 10k ohm
4.	Resistor 221 ohm
5.	Single Turn Potentiometer
6.	Buzzer
7.	Breadboard
8.	Jumper Wires

First I initiated making of this device by setting up Push buttons. Following them, I connected them along with the resistors. Then I attached a speaker. Thereafter, LCD was connected using jumper wires. Lastly, I connected potentiometer.
