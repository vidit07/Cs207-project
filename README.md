# Cs207-project
The project is creation of “Kitchen Timer”. It can be elaborated as a thing in which we can set a timer for a certain period of time and as soon as the timer hits its limit, the speaker attached with the timer automatically switches on.

The Kitchen Timer consist total of Eight Components. All components are named as follows: 

1.	Adafruit Standard LCD – 16x2
2.	Sparkfun Pushbutton switch 
3.	Resistor 10k ohm
4.	Resistor 221 ohm
5.	Single Turn Potentiometer
6.	Buzzer
7.	Breadboard
8.	Jumper Wires

First I initiated making of this device by setting up Push buttons. Following them, I connected them along with the resistors. Then I attached a speaker. Thereafter, LCD was connected using jumper wires. Lastly, I connected potentiometer.
The timer would only perform an individual mode at respective times that is of only one mode at a time out of total four modes:

1.	IDLE MODE

Idle mode can be also known as the initial mode that is been set up after setting power up or been reset. The timer only works after the input which shows the currently set time amount.

2.	SETUP
Through pressing of long pressing reset button one can enter in the setup mode. By using of start stop button we can choose the value which will help to change that the time that is elapsed which is counted down later. Finally, using up and down we can choose the value of time through increasing and decreasing the values. 

3.	RUNNING
We can enter into the running mode by pressing of start stop button and if one want to return back from running mode then it will require the pressing of both start stop and reset buttons which will ultimately take it back to initial mode.

4.	RINGING

This is mode which is achieved when the amount of time has completed and the buzzer starts ringing. If we want to stop the buzzer ringing then we can stop it by pressing any of switches.
